## R-CNN

Regions with CNN features

input image -> region proposals

- Region proposals: Generate class-independent candidate boxes with high recall
- Methods: Selective search, edgeBox, etc

wraped region to a NN (finedtuned AlexNet)


## Fast R-CNN

- Room for improvement

## Multi-Task Learning

- Jointly learn different tasks with the same aechitecture
- Differs from transfer learning (which is sequential)

## 3D Data Representation

### Point Clouds
A set of 3D points (N x 3)

- **Pros**:
    - Efficient coverage of space (only represent non-empty space)

- **Cons**:
    - Connectivity is not given (need to run nearest neighbours to identify closest point)

### Voxel Grid

Binary occupancy map of size N x M x K
1s indicate presence of an object

- **Pros**:
    - Connectivity is known, therefore easy to process.

- **Cons**:
    - Not efficient, as one need to cover whole 3D space, including large empty areas
    - The object surface loses smoothness properties, due to resolution constrains

### Meshes

A set of 3D points (N x 3) called **vertices**, and a set of **faces** (usually triangles, M x 3) that connect the vertices

- **Pros**:
    - Connectivity given via the faces
    - More efficient than voxel grids
    - Suitable for obtaining surface normals
    - Can be textured

- **Cons**:
    - Optimization not very easy
    - Memory overhead compared to point clouds
