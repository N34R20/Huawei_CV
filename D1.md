# Lecture 1

## Motivation and Fundamentals

What does the computer see?
- Vectors


What do i see?

## Computer Vision 

Field of Computer Science that aims to make sense at image/video

## Scene Understandig

Aspect of Computer Vision 

Image Segmentation

Between 2D and 3D

**Rendering** (a Graphics problem)

**Inverse Rendering** (a Vision problem)
- Given an image of a scene, infer the 3D model
- Under-constrained, ill-posed (proyective ambigueity)

- 2D -> Algorithm -> 3D

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    f_x & 0   & c_x \\
    0   & f_y & c_y  \\
    0   & 0   & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

| Image | -> Feature detection -> Feature description -> Tasks:
- Matching
- Detection
- Homography estimation 

## Edge detection

- Use derivatives (in x and y direction) to obtain pixels with high gradient
- Need smoothing to reduce noise prior to taking derivative

## Corner Detetcion

- **Repeatability**
- **Saliency**
- **Locality**

Harris Corner detector algorithm

Difference of Gaussians (DoG)

SIFT Descriptor


## Image Classification performance


## SUpervised Learning

- Training set of _N_ samples $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$
