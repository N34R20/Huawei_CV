# 3D Understanding & Novel View Synthesis

Goals:

- Understand the topic of novel view synthesis and getting a feeeling for its applications
- Fully grasp the concetp of NeRFs and Gaussian Splatting as the two most important techniques

## Novel View synthesis

Input 
- A set of input images capturing a scene from different viewpoints

Output
- A representation that
